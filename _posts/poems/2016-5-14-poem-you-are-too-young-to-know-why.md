Night coming,<br />
light twirling,<br />
when the door opens,<br />
you are ready to be Queen.

Make up,<br />
cold smile,<br />
but you are not bad enough.<br />
You only scare yourself.

You are too young to know why<br />
he asks you to be right,<br />
but he always does something bad.<br />
It is dark as tonight.

Your heart follows the music.<br />
You try to hold the whole world.<br />
And then you understand<br />
that not everyone is good.

You need to find the right one.<br />
It is harder than you thought.<br />
You are back to that nice girl<br />
when the sun comes out.
